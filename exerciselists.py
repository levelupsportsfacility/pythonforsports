# create a list

# how to remove from the list
# exercises.pop(0)  # 0 is the first one in the list

# Let's build a loop
#for x in range(0,len(exercises)):
#    exercises[x]
#    print

# creating a sorted list
#exercises.sort()

# print an item on the exercise list
#print(exercises[1]) # this prints out the second item on the list
